  Ideally we would use the preset, but with Tailwind v4 CSS-first approach, 
  we might need to ensure the JS config is picked up or these values are used.
  For now, we keep this minimal and let the JS config do the heavy lifting via the plugin/preset if supported.
  
  However, with @tailwindcss/postcss, a tailwind.config.ts is respected.
